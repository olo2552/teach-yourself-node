# Prerequisites
As it is interactive course, you need to have some stuff on your computer in order everything to work.

## Minimal requirements
- [GIT](), which makes it possible to fix thing up, if you blow something up (which is highly encouraged!)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), which makes it possible to build every example in this course, and makes sure, that everything _just works_.
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/Yelp/docker-compose/blob/master/docs/install.md), which makes it possible to run every example and exercise with just one command
- **Editor of our choice**. If you don't have any favourites, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great starter.

## These might help
If You're doing the boring stuff anyway, You can also get **useful stuff** at one go. Or if you're getting bored, feel free to come back later.
  - [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/)\-based browser might be use useful- it has very good developer tools, which you can link with Node.
  - [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) can help you easily test your Node server
  - [**N**ode **V**ersion **M**anager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update). 
  If you want to have NodeJS on your machine. NVM keeps your Node up-to-date

The rule is simple:
> If you don't know what it does, you don't need it.
