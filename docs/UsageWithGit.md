# Make yourself safe with GIT

[GIT]() is an awesome tool. If you don't know it yet, take a look at [DevTips' tutorial](). 
It's quick and to the point, and will give you the ability of "saving" your results, and ["replay"](./Replay.md) after something bad happens.

#### How do you start?
0. Create the copy of the repository to your account, by click `fork` button in the upper-right section of the GitHub repository.
1. Clone the repo with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/teach-yourself-node.git
```

2. Go to the project folder:
```bash
cd teach-yourself-node
```

If you have the [Prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md), you're ready to go.

Keep in mind, that you can do anything you want, just as in every other repository, i.e.
- `reset`ing
- `branching`ing
- `commit`ing
etc.

Just remember, that if you commit bad changes ["replay"](./Replay.md) could not work properly for you.

Of course, everything is `revert`able if you know GIT. Atlassian did a great tutorial on [undoing changes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes).
