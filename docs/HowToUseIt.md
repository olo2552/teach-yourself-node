# How to use this course?

## Teach yourself to _be brave_
This course is meant not only to teach you NodeJS, but also prepare you to the commercial battlefield.
Important part of the software development is the ability to have enough agility and dexterity to quickly scout through the project and get to work fast.

I wanted to make the course close to commercial project to give you a borader view on software development in general.
- You need to have [things installed](./Prerequisites.md) to start
- You are adviced to follow conventions
- You need to travel through the folder structure to the the stuff you want
- You are **NOT** dismissed from thinking- you have to solve problems on your own
- Nobody will lead you by the hand- it's your job to learn things.
- You don't need to know everything! Just enough to get yourself running.

## Not that scary as you can presume
I know it is hard at first, but it's also everyone should pass. There are no corner cuts...
The more you do now, the easier for you it will be on the real project.

To make things easier I've got tips for you:
- Files starting with dot (therefore called [dotfiles](https://www.quora.com/What-are-dotfiles)), such as `.gitignore` in the root folder are usually not strictly relevant to the code _per se_.
They usually store some configuration, and environment dependent metadata. You're covered on the configuration, if not specified otherwise.
- Files starting `_withUnderscore`, or in `__dunder__` notation usually mean _"do not touch me directly"_. 
I keep there infrastructure for the code, be encouraged to look at them one day.
- `README.md` always stands for _"read me first, if you see me"_.
I hope I don't need to explain more.
- `src` folders stands for _"source"_- the relevant code goes there.
