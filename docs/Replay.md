# Replay

If you're here, then- **congratulations!**

You have broken the code, and you will break it a lot more in your future career.

This is only the course, so you can go back in time, but try not to abuse it- You will not have such ability in real life as often as you wold want to have.

To revive the state to the last commited changes, just _"reset hard"_:
```bash
git reset --hard
```
