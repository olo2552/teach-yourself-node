# teach-yourself-node
Interactive NodeJS course focusing on experimenting and breaking things up.

## For who is this course?
You are either _not-so-beginner_, or _brave-enough_ not to be scared of taking care of yourself. I assume, that **this is not your first attempt to programming and JavaScript**. 

You've tackled with JS for some time, but you want to know **more**. You probably want to gain the feel of _"I finally know how the things work!"_. 

Ideally you have some coding experience, so:
- You realize, that good coder **just knows how to search the Internet for help** 
- You're aware, that _debugging_ and _fixing_ the code is very important part of programming.
- You know the very basics of [GIT](). See [DevTips' tutorial, if you're not.]() It's quick and to the point. Great starting point.
- You're not scared of terminal, it's just a tool all in all. [Hak5's "Terminal 101" is good resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5NmtmNwMgU)

## Some things need to be installed first
In order to run the course You need to have these folks installed:
  - [GIT](), which makes it possible to fix thing up, if you blow something up (which is highly encouraged!)
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), which makes it possible to build every example in this course, and makes sure, that everything _just works_.
  - [Docker Compose](https://github.com/Yelp/docker-compose/blob/master/docs/install.md), which makes it possible to run every example and exercise with just one command
  - **Editor of our choice**. If you don't have any favourites, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is _more than good enough_ for us.


If You're doing the boring stuff anyway, You can also get **useful stuff** in one sweel swoop, or come back later:
  - [**N**ode **V**ersion **M**anager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update). 
  If you want to have NodeJS on your machine. NVM keeps your Node up-to-date
  - [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/)\-based browser might be use useful- it has very good developer tools, which you can link with Node.
  - [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) can help you easily test your Node server

The rule is simple:
> If you don't know what it does, you don't need it.

## Before you begin...

### Don't be scared to **BREAK THINGS**
The more you blow up, the more you learn. There is nothing to worry about- nothing bad will happen, because everything can be easily revived.
In case things get screwed up and you don't really know what to do:
**You can always reach out for the ["replay" command]()**

### Remember, that **YOU** are teaching yourself
Typically on a course you need to listen to some boring teacher for some time, and then start to code. Here, **you are both the teacher and the pupil** in the same time. That means, that the materials

2. You can (and **should!**) experiment with the code.
After running the example server will watch for file changes and update automatically.
    > Hint: Don't forget to save the changes.
3. You can (and **should!**) break stuff. T
4. In order everything to work, **some files needed to be hide from you.** These not relevant files are stored in folders, which `_startsWithUnderscore`.
    > Hint for Advanced Folks: No one tells, that you can't browse this files anyway ;)

## I have everything- can we start?
Sure, we're not here to bore you. You've got your tools to fire things up, but you also need to briefly know how to use them. See the [warmup section]()- an interactive tutorial showing how can you work with this course.
