# teach-yourself-node
Interactive NodeJS course focusing on experimenting and breaking things up.

## For who is this course?
You are either _not-so-beginner_, or _brave-enough_ not to be scared of taking care of yourself. I assume, that **this is not your first attempt** to both JavaScript programming and programming in general. 

You've tackled with JS for some time, but you want to know **more**. You probably want to gain the feel of _"I finally know how the things work!"_. 

Ideally you have some coding experience, so:
- You realize, that good coder **just knows how to search the Internet for help** 
- You're aware, that _debugging_ and _fixing_ the code is very important part of programming.
- You know the very basics of [GIT](). See [DevTips' tutorial, if you're not.]() It's quick and to the point. Great starting point.
- You're not scared of terminal, it's just a tool all in all. [Hak5's "Terminal 101" is good resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5NmtmNwMgU)

## Some things need to be installed first
The beginnings are always most boring, but it's something that is needed to be done.

Make sure you have all the [prerequirements](./docs/Prerequisites.md) on your machine.

You might also take a quick glance at [usage with GIT]() in order to have full experience.

## Before you begin...
#### Don't be scared to **BREAK THINGS**
Experimenting is meant to be easy. When you run the code, server watches for file changes, so the only thing you need to see results is to save the file!

Remember, **the more you blow up, the more you learn**. There is nothing to worry about- nothing bad will happen, because everything can be easily revived.

In case the things got screwed up and you don't know what to do:
**You can always reach out for the ["replay" command]()**

#### Don't forget, that **YOU** are teaching yourself
Typically on a course you need to listen to some boring teacher for some time, and then start to code. Here, **you are both the teacher and the pupil** in the same time. That means, that the materials are only a blurry direction for your journey. But the last word is always **yours**.

Find something boring? Feel that you already know something? Something is too hard? Maybe you have just a "bad day"...

Skip modules, change the order, google the things up, tackle with the examples, take breaks. You know better what work best for you. :)

#### There are no limits, _but_...
Some things needed to written, in order to code _just works_ for you. There are some meta file in the codebade, that you don't need to care about.

> Everything that is not relevant for you as a learner is stored in folders, which `_startsWithUnderscore`. 

I don't say that you're forbidden to go there, just keep in mind, that if you need to edit `_metaFiles` it's rather bug than a feature.

## I have everything- can we start?
Sure, we're not here to bore you. You've got your tools to fire things up, but you also need to briefly know how to use them. See the [warmup section]()- an interactive tutorial showing how can you work with this course.
